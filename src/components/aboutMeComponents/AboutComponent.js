        <p>Hi, I am a self taught Front End Developer. So far, I have created projects to solve everyday problems that I have and I have been contributing to open source projects. Through my self taught journey, I have fallen in love with ReactJs, Redux, JavaScript, and Web Developing in general! I have been programming since I was around nine years old starting with Python and eventually tried Web Development; I instantly knew that it was the career path for me! Although self taught is not conventional route, I did take a 6-month course at CodeCademy and completed the Front-End Development path at freeCodeCamp. With that, I have been motivated and dedicated for over half my life to being a Web Developer and I wont stop there!</p>
