Hey there, my name is Nehemiah and this is my portfolio! It is mobile responsive and made with React and TailwindCSS. This portfolio also utilizes React themes and Tailwind themes in order to provide the user with the ability to switch between light and dark mode. This site was designed from scratch by me so I figured out the layout and sourced the color palette without the use of templates. This project links you to other projects I have worked on in the past!
