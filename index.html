                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi! I'm Nehemiah Dias and I'm pusuing a career in computer science, specifically as a Full-Stack Developer. I've been interested and passively learning code since I was in the eighth grade starting with Python! I really started to actively learn code in sophomore year of high school with the intention of majoring in Computer Science in college (which I did). I branched out to HTML/CSS, JavaScript, More Python, C++, C#, and Java and on the path to learn React and SQL to be well versed enough to become a Full-Stack Developer.

                <p>As I said before, I majored in Computer Science in College with the plan to get my Backelor's Degree and eventually a Masters but one day I set up a meeting with my Professor and Counselor to see what the curriculum would be for my major. I looked very closely and thought to myself "Four years, for this?" I knew college wouldn't make me a good enough programmer to actually get a job! So what'd I do? Well, what any normal person would and drop out of my Private University and go to Community College for, you guessed it... Real Estate. The University I was at demotivated me so much by seeing how little skill they can provide, that coupled with being intimidated at other peoples' skill made me switch career paths. But then I realized I hated Real Estate and I'd only really be happy by being a programmer, so I enrolled in a Certificate Program where I knew I could actually learn practical skills at a fast enough pace because lets face it, writing a guess the number game for two weeks in college wasn't cutting it.
                </p>

                <p>So hear I am becoming the great programmer that I know I can be! I am an analytical thinker, a problem solver, a very fast learner, I'm motivated, and, best of all, I have amazing social skills! Thanks for reading!</p>

                <img src="./resources/images/promo-gen-ss.jpg" width="500px" alt="photo of promo generator program" />
                <p>This is a Promo Code Generator I made for a business that I started. The goal was to incentivise word of mouth by giving referalls 10% off if they use the correct code. The code redeemed gives 10% off the next service stackable up to 50%. To make this profitable, someone can only redeem a code once but they can give their code to as many people as they like as long as they actually used my service. I made it automatically generate a code of random letters and numbers and email that code to the person who requested one, then it saved their email, code, and how many times their code was used.</p>

                <img src="./resources/images/wallpaper-sorter-ss.jpg" width="500px" alt="photo of wallpaper sorter program" />
                <p>I used to be obsessed with my computer setups colors to the point to where I'd set my wallpaper based on what RGB color was set to my LEDs. It was really annoying to manually download and sort every single wallpaper that I wanted to use into their own seperate color files. The website that I used fortunately added the name of the color at the end of each downloaded wallpaper. With that, I created a file sorter that put the wallpapers in their corresponding folder based on the color of the image. This is something I am proud of (even though it is super simple) because it showcases my problem solving and desire to make my quality of life better with the skills I have.</p>

                <p>This is a Portfolio project that I was assigned from the program I'm taking to learn to become a Full-Stack Developer. I was tasked with making a fake company website that is responsive and focuses on using flex. This company was created because my girlfriend wants to be a hair stylist so I decided to surprise her with her own salons' website to motivate her! Safe to say, she loves it almost as much as she loves pink.</p>

                <p>Finally, this is another Portfolio project that I was assigned. This is a fake club website that I had to make to practice my responsive design and making it friendly across all devices. I love coffee so I chose to make the club based around that and I was driving to San Fransisco while I was making it, hence SF. </p>
