                    <h2 class="project-title">Promo Code Generator</h2>
                    <p>A command line project which was also my first ever project! The purpose was to generate a Promo Code and email it to a customers' email automatically. I made this for a business that I started years ago, it made me fall in love with programming because it showcased that something so simple can solve any problem, it also felt really good to be the one to solve that problem. Although not pretty, it was very functional and fast and pretty good for a beginner.</p>

                    <p>A clone of the site, random.org. I made this because I use the original site to shuffle my spotify playlist but because the real sites' features are out of the scope, I only added the ones I use most or use the most. I made it a single page app because I wanted it to be fast and I love using React!</p>
